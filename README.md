## üìå Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early detection through machine learning can help doctors take proactive steps.  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the presence of heart disease from medical attributes.

‚ú® **Highlights**:
- Clean Data Preprocessing  
- Scikit-Learn Logistic Regression Model  
- Hyperparameter Tuning (`GridSearchCV`)  
- Accuracy & Classification Metrics  
- Prediction on Custom Input  
- Feature Importance Visualization
